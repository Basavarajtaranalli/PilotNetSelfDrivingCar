# PilotNet architecture for Self Driving Vehicle inside a game

![Poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aryarohit07/PilotNetSelfDrivingCar/master/poster.jpg)

This repo contains results and code of an experiment which I performed to steer vehicle inside a game.

I used [Nvidia's PilotNet Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316) to predict steering angle.

Please read [my blog](https://medium.com/@rohitarya/pilotnet-architecture-to-predict-vehicle-steering-angle-in-a-game-2aab41a5ef60) for more information.
